## Description 
It's a project with e2e tests to [angular-qa-recruitment-app](https://angular-qa-recruitment-app.netlify.app/)

I made it with JavaScript and Cypress

## How to run
1. Download the repository to your local environment
2. Make sure you have a Node.js
3. Open the repository and use

```bash
  npm i 
```
You are ready to run tests 😏 You can do it in two ways: 

#### Headed mode
Use
```bash
npm run test:e2e:open
```
and just choose tests to run.

#### Headless mode
Use
```bash
npm run test:e2e
```
It will run all tests. Result of them you can see in the terminal and in cypress/report/report.html file. If some test fails, there will be information about why, and a screenshot from the fail moment.
